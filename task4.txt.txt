The Amrita Blockchain Club seemed fascinating to me because I find blockchain technology really interesting, and it's becoming more and more important. I want to learn how blockchain works and explore the new world of blockchain. I truly believe that being part of this club will help me become a future blockchain developer. The seniors in the club are very helpful; it seems like a friendly place where I can learn a lot and acquire the skills required to build a career in blockchain.
